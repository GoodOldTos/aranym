The Aranym data folder contents are too big to be stored on GitHub. You can download the Aranym data package at:
http://vision.atari.org/download/aranym_data.tar.xz
-or-
https://vision.goodoldtos.com/download/aranym_data.tar.xz

Note that the container will download the full Aranym data package if easymint_c.img is not found.
So you should not care about manual download of this package unless it can't be automatically downloaded (e.g. if container does not have Internet access).

Thanks,
Good Old TOS
